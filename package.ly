%

\include "../oll-core/oll-core.ily"

\registerPackage breaks

% Register a named set of breaks that can be used later.
% Calling \registerBreakSet <break-set> will initialize the break set
% to have *no* entries for line and page breaks or page turns. However,
% the break set can be *used* already.
% <break-set> is a name that will be globally visible. This is so it can
% be used from different packages. However, this means the user has to take
% care of providing unique names.
registerBreakSet =
#(define-void-function (break-set) (symbol?)
   (let ((base-path `(breaks break-sets ,break-set)))
     (setChildOption #t base-path 'line-breaks '())
     (setChildOption base-path 'page-breaks '())
     (setChildOption base-path 'page-turns '())))

% Define *one* break set.
% #1: <break-set>
%     must be the name of a registered break set
% #2: <type>
%     must be one out of 'line-breaks 'page-breaks 'page-turns
% #3: <breaks>
%     a list of breaks. Each break can either be an integer
%     (referring to a bar number) or a two-element list with
%     an integer (bar number) and a fraction (zero-based moment).
% Example:
% \setConditionalBreaks original-edition line-breaks #'(4 8 (11 1/4) 15)
setConditionalBreaks =
#(define-void-function (break-set type breaks)
   (symbol? symbol? list?)
   (setChildOption
    `(breaks break-sets ,break-set) type breaks))
